##INTRODUCTION

##The problem I am researching is "What is the most popular American sport, Football, Baseball or Basketball"

##The questions I will ask are "What are the viewer totals for regular season and post-season games?"  "Which sport has the highest ad revenue"
##and "What sport has the most season ticket holders"

##This is how I will attempt to solve the problem "I will analyze the totals from all three sports for all three questions and compare them
##with a correlation chart

##These are my data sets

##Data set 1
##https://www.statista.com/statistics/289979/nfl-number-of-tv-viewers-usa/

##Data set 2
##https://www.statista.com/statistics/235678/world-series-tv-viewership-in-the-united-states/

##Data set 3
##https://www.statista.com/statistics/289993/nba-number-of-tv-viewers-usa/

##These are the packages I will need to breakdown the data sets
##Corrplot

##These are the tables and plots required
##Xtable

##This is what I do not currently know what to do in order to solve the problem
##if reliable information or enough reliable information exists
